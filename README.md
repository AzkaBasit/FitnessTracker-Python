# FitnessTracker-Python
# Background  
The project is being take to develop a basic and user-friendly fitness and health app/program. The code will take various parameters such as calories burnt in a day, calorie intake and Pedometer readings to suggest diet and health plans and to give an organized data.  

# Objectives: 
What the system will achieve 
•	Take various health parameters as Input

•	Convert the raw data into organized data and manage it

•	Suggest fitness tips to the user based on his/her physical activities 

# Plan of Action 
First using help of an already existing app or program for calculating calories burnt during the day by taking in steps taken (Pedometer) 
1. we will write a code to intake that data, organize it, show daily calories burnt
2. decide whether the calories burnt in enough, less or more than required based on the person’s height, calories intake and weight. 3. Then suggest a plan for improvement to the person. Using GUI from Python Libraries we can make the program look more presentable.

# Scope 
1.	End Result:
The project undertaken will develop a basic code for a fitness app, the code can later be improvised.
 
2. Phases of Work: 
•	Searching for different ideas and selecting one
•	Writing a pseudo code and algorithm
•	Writing the Code in a specific order
•	Debugging and finalizing the project
 
# Tools and Software Requirements 
•	A python IDE
•	An Already Existing and well-functioning Pedometer.
•	An app for calculating calories burnt based on reading from Pedometer and other Physical work.
•	Use of SDK
